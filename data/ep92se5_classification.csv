"Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty percent of all people know that.",Neutra
"I see. Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing?",Positiva
"Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes.",Neutra
Touch√©.,Neutra

Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!,Positiva
Asleep at the switch! I wasn't asleep! I was drunk!,Positiva
"I believe you, Dad.",Negativa
"Well, no matter what the paper says, I still have a job to do.",Positiva

Come back. I'll tell you.,Neutra
He was right under my nose the whole time. He lives in my retirement home. His name is Molloy.,Neutra
"Wow! How'd you track him down, Grampa?",Neutra
Good question.,Neutra
On one of my frequent trips to the ground... I noticed Molloy wore sneakers.,Neutra
For sneaking! My next clue came just yesterday at the museum. We felt slighted by your age-bashing and started home.,Positiva
"Molloy said, 'I'll catch up with you.'",Neutra
"I couldn't quite put my finger on it. There was something strange about the way he walked. Much more vertical than usual. And finally, Molloy, unlike most retired people, has the world's largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table.",Neutra
"Aw, Dad, I could kiss you.",Positiva
Well kiss me right here. It's the only part that still has feeling.,Neutra
No wait! I know where the burglar is!,Positiva
