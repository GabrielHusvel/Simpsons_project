    "    \"The Simpsons' home is robbed by the Springfield Cat Burglar, who steals Lisa's saxophone, Bart's stamp collection, and Marge's necklace.  Homer is unconcerned, but the family discovers many of their neighbors have also been targeted.  Chief Wiggum's inept investigation leads to a city-wide panic.  Professor Frink demonstrates a high-tech security system that inadvertently causes chaos in the streets.  The burglar is eventually revealed to be Grampa Simpson, who was stealing to fund his gambling habit.  Despite the chaos and loss, Homer promises to get Lisa a replacement saxophone, and he is elected leader of the neighborhood watch, despite his questionable methods and lack of experience. The episode begins with the discovery of the robbery and ends with Homer taking charge of the neighborhood watch, showcasing his incompetence and the absurdity of the situation.\",\n",
    "    \"The episode starts with the Springfield residents needing a leader for a community group.  Despite Ned Flanders's initial nomination, Homer Simpson unexpectedly wins the role by promising action without thinking.  He recruits a ragtag team including Moe, Barney, Skinner, and even Grampa (initially rejected due to his age).  Their vigilante group acquires weapons from Herman Hermann's military surplus store, engaging in petty vandalism and heavy-handed 'justice'.  Their antics include harassing people, confiscating saxophones, and generally causing more chaos than they solve.  The group's actions lead to an interview with Kent Brockman, where Homer admits to their criminal activities.  The episode culminates with a phone call from the cat burglar, who taunts Homer by revealing he has Marge's pearls and Lisa's saxophone.  Homer vows to protect the Springfield Museum's cubic zirconia, highlighting the absurdity of the situation and the group's overall ineffectiveness.\",\n",
    "    \"The episode starts with Homer's self-proclaimed \\\"gang\\\" inadvertently causing more crime than they prevent, while Lisa's saxophone is stolen by a cat burglar.  Homer, appearing on a TV interview with Kent Brockman, hilariously denies his gang's criminal activities. The cat burglar calls into the show, taunting Homer and revealing his next target: the world's largest cubic zirconia at the Springfield Museum.  Homer vows to protect it, but his efforts are hampered by his own incompetence and his father's antics.  Grandpa Simpson, despite his age and frequent falls, unexpectedly solves the mystery, deducing the burglar's identity (Molloy, a resident of his retirement home) through astute observation.  The climax sees Molloy apprehended at the retirement home, returning all the stolen goods, including Lisa's saxophone.  Despite Molloy's charming confession and the crowd's plea for leniency, Chief Wiggum arrests him, only to be bribed by Mayor Quimby. The episode ends with Homer mistakenly believing he caught the burglar himself, highlighting the comedic absurdity of the situation and Homer's self-delusion.\",\n",
    "    \"The episode starts at the Springfield Retirement Castle, where the notorious cat burglar, Molloy, is apprehended, not by the police, but by Grampa Simpson.  Molloy, surprisingly charming, returns the stolen goods, including Selma's lock of MacGyver's hair and Lisa's saxophone.  Despite the heartwarming moment, Chief Wiggum arrests Molloy, only to receive a bribe from Mayor Quimby.  The plot thickens when Molloy reveals he buried his loot under a big \\\"T\\\" somewhere in Springfield.  Homer, convinced he'll find the treasure, causes chaos searching for it.  Molloy gives increasingly vague directions, leading to a town-wide panic and a bizarre scene with Kent Brockman suggesting cannibalism.  The search ends in a park, with nothing found but a note signed by someone Homer can't identify.  The episode concludes with the group digging futilely, highlighting the absurdity of the situation and the incompetence of the Springfield authorities.\",\n",
